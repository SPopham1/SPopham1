# Hi, I'm Sam Popham

I'm a Computer Science student at the **University of Bath** (2024–2028) with interests in  
**software development, interactive technologies, computer graphics, and AI**.  
I enjoy building systems that combine creativity with technical depth — from raytracers to full-stack web apps.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:**  
Python, C++, Java, Haskell, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Tools & Libraries:**  
Git, VS Code, Blender, Unity, Tkinter, PyQt6

**Databases:**  
MongoDB, SQL

## Highlight Projects

### Offline Ray Tracer (C++)
A physically based raytracer built from scratch following the *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* series.  
Deepened my understanding of rendering pipelines, light simulation, and graphics fundamentals.

### Chess Bot with GUI (Python, Tkinter)
A chess-playing AI with full GUI integration.  
Includes move validation, board rendering, and strategic decision-making.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Web App (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebSockets) — *In progress*
A real-time multiplayer browser game with a responsive UI.  
Currently implementing WebSocket-based communication and matchmaking.

### Weather Reporter Desktop App (Python, PyQt6)
A multi-city weather application powered by the OpenWeatherMap API.  
Features a structured GUI, API integration, and asynchronous data handling.
